# vets-api-clients (VA Lighthouse APIs)

Welcome to the repository for consumers of **Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Lighthouse APIs**.  It includes API specifications, sample clients, and general access information.   Anything **older than April 2019** may be considered deprecated.  **For the most up-to-date Lighthouse API documentation, please visit [developer.va.gov/explore](https://developer.va.gov/explore).**

If you would like to improve or suggest **edits to API documentation** for the VA APIs, please visit the [APIs repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api) or the [Developer Portal repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/developer-portal).

If you are a third party seeking access to VA Lighthouse APIs, you will need to complete a quick application to obtain an API key. Once you have your API key, you can access our APIs in a Sandbox environment. Production access will be granted later by scheduling a [demo of your application](https://developer.va.gov/go-live) for stakeholders.
